<p>After travelling in the past few weekends, I finally found some time to look at some potentially interesting data provided by <a href = 'https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SG.DMK.ALLD.FN.ZS'> The World Bank </a>.</p>
<p><strong>World Bank estimated scores for women participating in three major decisions: own healthcare, major household purchases and visiting family</strong>. I wanted to see how the trend on these has changed over time/which countries have highest &amp; lowest score.</p>
<p>I started the work by reading in the data using <code>readr</code>. After downloading and unzipping the files, I placed them inside “data” folder in my repo:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>path &lt;- &#39;../women-making-decisions/data/&#39; </code></pre>
<p>There are several files in the folder (3 files are downloaded automatically), and their names are tedious, so I wanted to do it in several steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step 1: find all files in the folder (the path folder we just saved into R)</li>
<li>Step 2: select the one we want</li>
</ul>
<p>My original code does exactly that:</p>
<pre class="r"><code>file_list &lt;- list.files(path=&quot;data/&quot;)

df &lt;- readr::read_csv(paste0(&#39;data/&#39;, file_list[1]), skip = 3)

df_additional_1 &lt;-readr::read_csv(paste0(&#39;data/&#39;, file_list[2]))
df_additional_2 &lt;-readr::read_csv(paste0(&#39;data/&#39;, file_list[3]))</code></pre>
<p>But, turns out, R markdown <em>really</em> doesn’t like it when we try to list files in another repo. There’s a reported reproducible bug that I found, so maybe one day :) . Therefore, this is the code for you if you want to follow along this tutorial:</p>
