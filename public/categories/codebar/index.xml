      <description>Originally writted for codelog on Medium.  codebar Helsinki is now over a year old; the idea having been born at a TEDx event here in Helsinki. There was a talk about volunteering which reminded James about how he used to coach at codebar Cambridge. We contacted codebar and that’s how it began!
The past year Our first workshop was hosted by MOW back in June 2018, the co-working space in which James’s employer, Verifa, was located.</description>

      <description>Originally writted for codelog on Medium. To go along with the opening of a new codebar chapter in Helsinki, here is a quick Q&amp;amp;A with the organisers (Anastasia Kuprina and James Elderfield) to let them introduce themselves.
What motivated you to bring codebar to Helsinki? James: I used to coach with the codebar chapter in Cambridge, UK, and loved it. I ended up moving to Helsinki for work, and found myself missing the fun of codebar.</description>
