      <description>Using SteamSpy data, I was interested in seeing how many games are released on a daily basis. There was a clear trend in some days having higher number of new releases than others. It appears that most popular release day is Friday, followed by Thursday!
Total releases by dates The trend highlighted that there are a lot less releases on the weekends compared to the weekdays:

      <description>To finally try my hands on map visualisations, I used this publicly available dataset from NYC Open Data
Data is very nice and tidy so it actually took less than an hour to create a simlpe (interactive when not PNG) plot using Leaflet: This is using the following libraries:
 lettercase (has a neat substitution for make.names but uses underscores instead!) tidyverse leaflet mapview webshot htmlwidgets htmltools magrittr  </description>

      <description>Originally writted for codelog on Medium.  codebar Helsinki is now over a year old; the idea having been born at a TEDx event here in Helsinki. There was a talk about volunteering which reminded James about how he used to coach at codebar Cambridge. We contacted codebar and that’s how it began!
The past year Our first workshop was hosted by MOW back in June 2018, the co-working space in which James’s employer, Verifa, was located.</description>

      <title>TidyTuesday: Women in the workforce</title>

      <description>TidyTuesday published data from the Census Bureau about women in the workforce. Equality and diversity are close to my heart and I couldn&amp;rsquo;t pass on this data. The data was showing - from all angles - that in categories that were given by Census Bureau, the pay gap is huge. At the same time, using same data, we can see what is the balance of females &amp;amp; males in the industry like.</description>

      <title>TidyTuesday: Remakes of Economist charts</title>

      <description>tidytuesday-economist-remakes TidyTuesday had a task of redesigning the charts Economist mentioned at some point. Here is the original article: https://medium.economist.com/mistakes-weve-drawn-a-few-8cdd8a42d368
Original chart I chose to work with: Original chart (&amp;ldquo;better&amp;rdquo;) made in R: I did a small makeover to show the &amp;ldquo;remorse&amp;rdquo; part in more detail:
I like named y axis and I also prefer to have percentage sign there. As for &amp;ldquo;Wrong&amp;rdquo; being the highlight - the original chart is called Bremorse and (I guess) is meant to show the increase of people who believe their decision to vote &amp;ldquo;Leave&amp;rdquo; was wrong.</description>

      <description>Originally writted for codelog on Medium. To go along with the opening of a new codebar chapter in Helsinki, here is a quick Q&amp;amp;A with the organisers (Anastasia Kuprina and James Elderfield) to let them introduce themselves.
What motivated you to bring codebar to Helsinki? James: I used to coach with the codebar chapter in Cambridge, UK, and loved it. I ended up moving to Helsinki for work, and found myself missing the fun of codebar.</description>
